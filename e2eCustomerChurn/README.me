Data Engineering Project: Building a Customer Churn Data Pipeline

Goal: To design, build, and automate a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) 
pipeline that ingests raw customer data, cleans and transforms it, and 
loads it into a structured SQL database, ready for analysis or a data science model.
