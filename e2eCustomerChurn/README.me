Data Engineering Project: Building a Customer Churn Data Pipeline

Goal: To design, build, and automate a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) 
pipeline that ingests raw customer data, cleans and transforms it, and 
loads it into a structured SQL database, ready for analysis or a data science model.

This project aims at showing my skills in :
Data Modelling and Database design
ETL Development using Python and SQL
Data Quality and Validation
Basic Orchestration
Problem solving and Data Governance

This project builds a ETL
1. Extract: Reads data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames
2. Load to Staging: Load these raw DataFrames into SQL staging tables
3. Transform and Load to Core: Read from staging tables, apply transformations, and loads into other sql tables
